# Health AI Project – Components Overview

This project integrates machine learning and interactive web technology to build a health-focused AI application. Below are the main components of the project:

---

## 🧠 1. Machine Learning Inference

- Uses a pre-trained model to make predictions based on health-related input data.
- `model.predict()` is used for performing inference.
- Can be extended with models like `RandomForest`, `LogisticRegression`, etc.

---

## 🧹 2. Data Processing

- Likely uses `pandas` and `numpy` for:
  - Data cleaning
  - Feature selection
  - Handling missing values
- Can be adapted to preprocess clinical datasets or health records.

---

## 📊 3. Visualization

- Integrates `plotly` for interactive data visualization.
- Helps in displaying insights, distributions, or model predictions visually.

---

## 🌐 4. Web Application with Streamlit

- Built using **Streamlit**, a Python-based web app framework.
- Offers a simple, interactive interface for:
  - Entering patient data
  - Viewing prediction results
  - Exploring visualizations

---

## 🚀 5. Deployment with Pyngrok

- Uses `pyngrok` to expose the Streamlit app to the web.
- Makes it accessible via a public URL even from a local machine or Colab.

---

## 🔧 6. Additional Utilities

- Logging and time management via Python's `logging`, `time`, and `datetime` modules.
- Background threading possibly used to support async or parallel operations.
- Uses `transformers` library, suggesting potential for NLP or language-based health modeling.

---

## ✅ Summary

This modular architecture allows the Health AI system to:
- Clean and process real-world health data
- Predict health conditions or outcomes
- Visualize results for better interpretability
- Provide a user-friendly interface for clinicians or end-users
